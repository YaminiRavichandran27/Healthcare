# Diabetes Prediction ML Project

## Overview

This project involves the use of machine learning techniques to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various health metrics. The dataset used contains features such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more. The goal is to build a model that can effectively classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from a public dataset containing the following features:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-diabetic)

## Project Structure


- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook with the analysis and model development.
- `models/`: Stores the trained machine learning models.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions (this file).
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies required for the project.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to set up the environment and install the required libraries.
